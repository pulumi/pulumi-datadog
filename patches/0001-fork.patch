 ## Example Usage
 
 ```terraform
-# Note: Until terraform-provider-datadog version 2.1.0, service objects under the services key were specified inside the datadog_integration_pagerduty resource. This was incompatible with multi-configuration-file setups, where users wanted to have individual service objects controlled from different Terraform configuration files. The recommended approach now is specifying service objects as individual resources using datadog_integration_pagerduty_service_object.

 ### Required
 
-- `service_key` (String, Sensitive) Your Service name associated service key in PagerDuty. Note: Since the Datadog API never returns service keys, it is impossible to detect [drifts](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/detecting-and-managing-drift-with-terraform). The best way to solve a drift is to manually mark the Service Object resource with [terraform taint](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/taint.html) to have it destroyed and recreated.

 **Note:** APM latency data is now available as Distribution Metrics. Existing monitors have been migrated automatically but all terraformed monitors can still use the existing metrics. We strongly recommend updating monitor definitions to query the new metrics. To learn more, or to see examples of how to update your terraform definitions to utilize the new distribution metrics, see the [detailed doc](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/guide/ddsketch_trace_metrics/).
 - `type` (String) The type of the monitor. The mapping from these types to the types found in the Datadog Web UI can be found in the Datadog API [documentation page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/#create-a-monitor). Note: The monitor type cannot be changed after a monitor is created. Valid values are `composite`, `event alert`, `log alert`, `metric alert`, `process alert`, `query alert`, `rum alert`, `service check`, `synthetics alert`, `trace-analytics alert`, `slo alert`, `event-v2 alert`, `audit alert`, `ci-pipelines alert`, `ci-tests alert`, `error-tracking alert`.
