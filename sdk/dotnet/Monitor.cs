    /// ## Example Usage

    /// ```csharp

    /// using Datadog = Pulumi.Datadog;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()

    ///         // Create a new Datadog monitor

    ///                 Critical = 4,
    ///                 Critical_recovery = 3,
    ///             },
    ///             NotifyNoData = false,
    ///             RenotifyInterval = 60,
    ///             NotifyAudit = false,

    ///             {
    ///                 "foo:bar",

    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// ## Silencing by Hand and by Downtimes
    /// 
    /// There are two ways how to silence a single monitor:
    /// 
    /// * Mute it by hand
    /// * Create a Downtime
    /// 
    /// Both of these actions add a new value to the `silenced` map. This can be problematic if the `silenced` attribute doesn't contain them in your application, as they would be removed on next `pulumi up` invocation. In order to prevent that from happening, you can add following to your monitor:
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///     }
    /// 
    /// }
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// The above will make sure that any changes to the `silenced` attribute are ignored.
    /// 
    /// This issue doesn't apply to multi-monitor downtimes (those that don't contain `monitor_id`), as these don't influence contents of the `silenced` attribute.
    /// 
    /// ## Composite Monitors
    /// 
    /// You can compose monitors of all types in order to define more specific alert conditions (see the [doc](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/composite/)).
    /// You just need to reuse the ID of your `datadog.Monitor` resources.
    /// You can also compose any monitor with a `datadog.SyntheticsTest` by passing the computed `monitor_id` attribute in the query.
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Datadog = Pulumi.Datadog;
    /// 
    /// class MyStack : Stack
    /// {
    ///     public MyStack()
    ///     {
    ///         var bar = new Datadog.Monitor("bar", new Datadog.MonitorArgs
