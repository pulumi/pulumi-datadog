          * `recovery_window` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - describes how long an anomalous metric must be normal before the alert recovers.
          * `trigger_window` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - describes how long a metric must be anomalous before an alert triggers.

        The **thresholds** object supports the following:

          * `critical` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `critical_recovery` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `ok` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `unknown` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `warning` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
