    * `evaluation_delay` (Optional, only applies to metric alert) Time (in seconds) to delay evaluation, as a non-negative integer.
    For example, if the value is set to 300 (5min), the timeframe is set to last_5m and the time is 7:00,
    the monitor will evaluate data from 6:50 to 6:55. This is useful for AWS CloudWatch and other backfilled
    metrics to ensure the monitor will always have data during evaluation.
    """
    no_data_timeframe: pulumi.Output[float]
    """
    The number of minutes before a monitor will notify when data stops reporting. Must be at
    least 2x the monitor timeframe for metric alerts or 2 minutes for service checks. Default: 2x timeframe for
    metric alerts, 2 minutes for service checks. Defaults to 10 minutes.

    A boolean indicating whether this monitor needs a full window of data before it's evaluated.
    We highly recommend you set this to False for sparse metrics, otherwise some evaluations will be skipped.

    """
    A mapping containing `recovery_window` and `trigger_window` values, e.g. `last_15m`. Can only be used for, and are required for, anomaly monitors.
    * `recovery_window` describes how long an anomalous metric must be normal before the alert recovers.
    """
    thresholds: pulumi.Output[dict]
    """
    
    * Metric alerts:
    A dictionary of thresholds by threshold type. Currently we have four threshold types for metric alerts: critical, critical recovery, warning, and warning recovery. Critical is defined in the query, but can also be specified in this option. Warning and recovery thresholds can only be specified using the thresholds option.
    Example usage:
    ```
    thresholds = {
    critical          = 90
    critical_recovery = 85
    warning           = 80
    warning_recovery  = 75
    }
    ```
    **Warning:** the `critical` threshold value must match the one contained in the `query` argument. The `threshold` from the previous example is valid along with a query like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 90` but
    along with something like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 95` would make the Datadog API return a HTTP error 400, complaining "The value provided for parameter 'query' is invalid".
    * Service checks:
    A dictionary of thresholds by status. Because service checks can have multiple thresholds, we don't define them directly in the query.
    Default values:
    ```
    thresholds = {
    ok       = 1
    critical = 1
    warning  = 1
    unknown  = 1
    }

    The type of the monitor. The mapping from these types to the types found in the Datadog Web UI can be found in the Datadog API [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#create-a-monitor) page. Available options to choose from are:
