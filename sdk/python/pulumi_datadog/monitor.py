    * Metric alerts:
    A dictionary of thresholds by threshold type. Currently we have four threshold types for metric alerts: critical, critical recovery, warning, and warning recovery. Critical is defined in the query, but can also be specified in this option. Warning and recovery thresholds can only be specified using the thresholds option.
    Example usage:
    ```
    thresholds = {
    critical          = 90
    critical_recovery = 85
    warning           = 80
    warning_recovery  = 75

    ```
    **Warning:** the `critical` threshold value must match the one contained in the `query` argument. The `threshold` from the previous example is valid along with a query like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 90` but
    along with something like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 95` would make the Datadog API return a HTTP error 400, complaining "The value provided for parameter 'query' is invalid".
    * Service checks:
    A dictionary of thresholds by status. Because service checks can have multiple thresholds, we don't define them directly in the query.
    Default values:
    ```
    thresholds = {
    ok       = 1
    critical = 1
    warning  = 1
    unknown  = 1

        foo = datadog.Monitor("foo",

                "foo:bar",
                "baz",
            ])
        ```

        ## Silencing by Hand and by Downtimes

        There are two ways how to silence a single monitor:

        * Mute it by hand
        * Create a Downtime

        Both of these actions add a new value to the `silenced` map. This can be problematic if the `silenced` attribute doesn't contain them in your application, as they would be removed on next `pulumi up` invocation. In order to prevent that from happening, you can add following to your monitor:

        ```python
        import pulumi
        ```

        The above will make sure that any changes to the `silenced` attribute are ignored.

        This issue doesn't apply to multi-monitor downtimes (those that don't contain `monitor_id`), as these don't influence contents of the `silenced` attribute.

        ## Composite Monitors

        You can compose monitors of all types in order to define more specific alert conditions (see the [doc](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/composite/)).
        You just need to reuse the ID of your `.Monitor` resources.
        You can also compose any monitor with a `.SyntheticsTest` by passing the computed `monitor_id` attribute in the query.

        ```python
        import pulumi
        import pulumi_datadog as datadog

        bar = datadog.Monitor("bar",
            message="This is a message",
            name="Composite Monitor",
            query=f"{datadog_monitor['foo']['id']} || {datadog_synthetics_test['foo']['monitor_id']}",
            type="composite")
        ```

        :param pulumi.Input[float] no_data_timeframe: The number of minutes before a monitor will notify when data stops reporting. Provider defaults to 10 minutes.
               We recommend at least 2x the monitor timeframe for metric alerts or 2 minutes for service checks.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] notify_audit: A boolean indicating whether tagged users will be notified on changes to this monitor.
               Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] notify_no_data: A boolean indicating whether this monitor will notify when data stops reporting. Defaults
               to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] query: The monitor query to notify on. Note this is not the same query you see in the UI and
               the syntax is different depending on the monitor `type`, please see the [API Reference](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/#create-a-monitor) for details. **Warning:** `pulumi preview` won't perform any validation of the query contents.
        :param pulumi.Input[float] renotify_interval: The number of minutes after the last notification before a monitor will re-notify
               on the current status. It will only re-notify if it's not resolved.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] require_full_window: A boolean indicating whether this monitor needs a full window of data before it's evaluated.
               We highly recommend you set this to False for sparse metrics, otherwise some evaluations will be skipped.
               Default: True for "on average", "at all times" and "in total" aggregation. False otherwise.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] silenced: Each scope will be muted until the given POSIX timestamp or forever if the value is 0. Use `-1` if you want to unmute the scope. **Deprecated** The `silenced` parameter is being deprecated in favor of the downtime resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[list] tags: A list of tags to associate with your monitor. This can help you categorize and filter monitors in the manage monitors page of the UI. Note: it's not currently possible to filter by these tags when querying via the API
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] threshold_windows: A mapping containing `recovery_window` and `trigger_window` values, e.g. `last_15m`. Can only be used for, and are required for, anomaly monitors.
        :param pulumi.Input[dict] thresholds: 
               * Metric alerts:
               A dictionary of thresholds by threshold type. Currently we have four threshold types for metric alerts: critical, critical recovery, warning, and warning recovery. Critical is defined in the query, but can also be specified in this option. Warning and recovery thresholds can only be specified using the thresholds option.
               Example usage:
               ```
               thresholds = {
               critical          = 90
               critical_recovery = 85
               warning           = 80
               warning_recovery  = 75
               }
               ```
               **Warning:** the `critical` threshold value must match the one contained in the `query` argument. The `threshold` from the previous example is valid along with a query like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 90` but
               along with something like `avg(last_1h):avg:system.disk.in_use{role:sqlserver} by {host} > 95` would make the Datadog API return a HTTP error 400, complaining "The value provided for parameter 'query' is invalid".
               * Service checks:
               A dictionary of thresholds by status. Because service checks can have multiple thresholds, we don't define them directly in the query.
               Default values:
               ```
               thresholds = {
               ok       = 1
               critical = 1
               warning  = 1
               unknown  = 1
               }
               ```
        :param pulumi.Input[float] timeout_h: The number of hours of the monitor not reporting data before it will automatically resolve
               from a triggered state. Defaults to false.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] type: The type of the monitor. The mapping from these types to the types found in the Datadog Web UI can be found in the Datadog API [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/v1/monitors/#create-a-monitor) page. The available options are below. **Note**: The monitor type cannot be changed after a monitor is created.
               * `metric alert`
               * `service check`
               * `event alert`
               * `query alert`
               * `composite`
               * `log alert`

        The **threshold_windows** object supports the following:

          * `recovery_window` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - describes how long an anomalous metric must be normal before the alert recovers.
          * `trigger_window` (`pulumi.Input[str]`) - describes how long a metric must be anomalous before an alert triggers.

        The **thresholds** object supports the following:

          * `critical` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `critical_recovery` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `ok` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `unknown` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `warning` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
          * `warning_recovery` (`pulumi.Input[float]`)
